            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Out the Other Side Rafting was founded by a small crew of river guides who believed whitewater was about more than adrenaline—it was about what happens after the rapids. What started as a handful of trips for friends grew into a guiding company built on trust, teamwork, and deep respect for the river. Season after season, the mission stayed the same: guide people safely through wild water and send them home a little braver, closer, and more alive than when they arrived.
