        My name is Henrique Bermann, I am 21 years old, and I am currently studying through BYU Pathway Worldwide with plans to begin the Web & Computer Programming program at BYU Idaho.<br><br>
        I have a strong interest in technology, languages, and problem-solving, and I enjoy learning how computers and software work behind the scenes.<br><br>
        I also work at the Missionary Training Center in São Paulo, where I have developed communication, teamwork, and professionalism skills.<br><br>
        I am motivated, dedicated, and always looking for opportunities to grow both academically and professionally.
