        <p>
        My name is Henrique Bermann, I am 21 years old, and I am currently studying through BYU Pathway Worldwide with plans to begin the Web & Computer Programming program at BYU Idaho.<br><br>
        I have a strong interest in technology, languages, and problem-solving, and I enjoy learning how computers and software work behind the scenes.<br><br>
        I also work at the Missionary Training Center in São Paulo, where I have developed communication, teamwork, and professionalism skills.<br><br>
        I am motivated, dedicated, and always looking for opportunities to grow both academically and professionally.

        <p>
        Rio Grande do Sul is a state in southern Brazil known for its strong cultural traditions.<br><br>
        One of the most famous is churrasco, a style of barbecue where different cuts of meat are slowly grilled over open fire.<br><br>
        Another important tradition is chimarrão, a hot herbal drink made from yerba mate and shared socially among friends and family.<br><br>
        Both churrasco and chimarrão represent hospitality, tradition, and community in Rio Grande do Sul.<br><br>
